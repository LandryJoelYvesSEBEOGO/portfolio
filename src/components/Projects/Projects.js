Our initial results show that we're on the right track to creating fake signals effectively but is just the beginning, we're committed to making our methods even more accurate and secure. I also had the opportunity to work with a fantastic team on a scientific paper about this topic."

Early detection of microcalcifications is crucial in breast cancer screening. However, the dataset used in this project was highly imbalanced, which presented a significant challenge. This project was supervised by ECC CODING WEEK."

Throughout my project, I explored the relationship between genetics, statistics, and the spread of diseases. I began by delving into the importance of probabilities in genetics and how they are vital for genetic studies. From there, I went on to write a Python code to model the spread of a disease over time. Using this code, I was able to investigate the statistical evolution of a general hereditary disease, and gain insight into how these diseases'frequency vary over time."

In this project, we utilized OpenCV to analyze traffic images and extract traffic density information, which enabled us to develop an optimization code that dynamically adjusted traffic light timings to improve traffic flow and alleviate congestion in real-time. To assess the effectiveness of our optimization code, we compared our model with both a deep learning-based approach and a traditional timing system using a traffic simulator. Our results highlighted the potential of computer vision and machine learning techniques to optimize traffic control systems."
